# 16_Bit_Adder

This project aims to analyze various 16-bit adders to determine the best adder based on speed, power, and area. The project uses vector A (1111 1111 1111 1111 + 0000 0000 0000 0001) to observe the delay and select the required adder. The project analyzes two different architectures, namely 1-bit Complementary adder in a ripple carry chain and carry look-ahead adder, to improve performance. The 16-bit adder is built using repetitive 4-bit carry look-ahead adders, and the computation for sum and carry bits is performed simultaneously. The simulation results for different vectors and temperatures were analyzed, and it was determined that the delay is lowest at the FF corner and -25C and longest at the SS corner and 85C. The project concludes that carry look-ahead and carry select adder techniques can be used to design efficient 16-bit adders.
